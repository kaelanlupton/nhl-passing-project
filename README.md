# nhl-passing-project
Looking at the effects players with elite passing talents have on their linemates, especially those with elite finishing talent.

This project is inspired by thoughts of shooting percentage sustainability, elite passing talent, and work done by others (Sean Tierney, Ryan Stimson, Emmanuel Perry, etc). I'm curious to see how much elite passing talent is able to boost the shooting percentages, expected goals, and point production of linemates. The eye test says players like Joe Thornton, Mitch Marner, Sidney Crosby, and Mikko Rantanen are able to consistently set players up around them to perform better with passes others may simply not have the vision for. This is even more evident when these players are paired with elite shooting talent (Thornton with Marleau and others, Marner with Tavares, etc).

I'm looking for any interesting numeric insights on the subject. I'll likely be working entirely in Python and be making use of passing data by Ryan Stimson (https://public.tableau.com/profile/ryan.stimson#!/vizhome/PlayerPassing/ComparisonDashboard?publish=yes).
